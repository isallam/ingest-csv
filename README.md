# ingest-csv

## To run the test
1- execute the re-createfd script
   cd data
   ./recreatefd.sh
   cd ..
   
2- make sure you have data generated by "training-datagen" in the sourcedata directory.
3- run "gradle tasks" to see which tasks are available.
   e.g.
      gradle testIngestPhoneCalls
4- Any of the tesks can be run in any order, no new data will be added to the database if it's already ingested from the raw files
   (there is still one issue with the to-many relationship, there is no check to see if the data already existed in the list)
